Sherlock Holmes is back with a new case involving a mystical talking tiger. But animals can't talk, right?

That's what Sherlock thinks too as he walks through the dark forest. From what he had read in the morning newspaper, the tiger was in the Yellow Forest. He fires up his car and zooms through the forest in search of the great tiger.

As soon as he reaches the end of the forest, he sees the beast there, sitting as if it had been waiting for him.

Before he can speak, the tiger perks up and says:

“To go any further, answer this question: What does the word "adventure" mean?

A) A place where you keep your clothes

B) A fun and exciting journey or activity

C) A type of food you eat

D) A way to clean your room”

Sherlock, being the genius, answers correctly and asks the tiger about the great white house he was sitting in front of. The tiger replies, "You'll find the key if you go that way, but answer my question before you may: What does the word "gigantic" mean?

A) Very small

B) Very loud

C) Very big

D) Very fast"

Yay! Sherlock answers correctly again. The tiger moves, revealing the key. Sherlock beams, grabs the key, and runs to the house. There, he finds the great treasure of the Red Hat Pirate--a story for another time.
